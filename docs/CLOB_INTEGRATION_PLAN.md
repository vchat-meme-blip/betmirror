# 🧠 Polymarket CLOB & Builder Architecture Analysis

## 1. Architecture Comparison: Us vs. Them

We have migrated to **Gnosis Safe**. Both our system and Polymarket's native interface now use the same underlying smart account standards.

| Feature | Polymarket Native (Relayer) | Bet Mirror Pro (Safe) | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Contract** | Gnosis Safe Proxy | Gnosis Safe Proxy | **Identical.** We utilize the standard Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory used by Polymarket. |
| **Gas Handling** | Polymarket Relayer | Polymarket Relayer | **Identical.** We route transactions through the official Relayer to provide a gasless experience. |
| **Signing** | EOA Owner Signatures | EOA Owner Signatures | **Identical.** Our bot acts as the "Owner" (Signer) of the Safe, automating the signing process server-side. |
| **Order Matching** | Central Limit Order Book | Central Limit Order Book | **Identical.** We post to the same CLOB. |

## 2. The "Builder" Opportunity

Polymarket has a **Builder Program** that allows front-ends (like Bet Mirror) to earn rewards and attribution.

**Current State:**
- We connect to `https://clob.polymarket.com`.
- We use `@polymarket/builder-relayer-client` for execution.
- We use `@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk` for attribution headers.

**The Workflow:**
1.  **Registration:** The Platform Admin configures `POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY` in `.env`.
2.  **Attribution:** Every trade executed by a user's bot is stamped with this key via the `BuilderConfig` injected into the `ClobClient`.
3.  **Result:** Volume generated by Bet Mirror is tracked by Polymarket, potentially qualifying for grants or rebates.

## 3. Immediate Action: User Education
We need to explain to users that **we are a direct interface to the CLOB**. We are not a "Derivative" layer. When they trade on Bet Mirror, they are providing liquidity directly to the main Polymarket ecosystem using the same Safe architecture they use on the main site.
